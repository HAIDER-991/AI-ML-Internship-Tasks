# Task 2: End-to-End ML Pipeline for Customer Churn Prediction

## 🎯 Objective
Build a reusable and production-ready ML pipeline using Scikit-learn to predict customer churn.

## 🧠 Methodology
- Used ColumnTransformer for preprocessing
- Applied scaling and one-hot encoding
- Built pipelines for Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- Exported final pipeline using joblib

## 📊 Key Results
- Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression
- Pipeline approach ensured clean and reusable workflow
- Model ready for production deployment
