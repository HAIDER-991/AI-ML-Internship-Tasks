## 🧪 Models Applied
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Random Forest Regressor**

---

## 🔧 Steps Performed
1. Downloaded stock data using `yfinance`
2. Created "Next Close" column (shifted by 1 day)
3. Selected input features
4. Split dataset (80% train / 20% test)
5. Trained regression models
6. Visualized actual vs predicted prices
